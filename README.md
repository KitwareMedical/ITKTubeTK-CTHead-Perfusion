# ITKTubeTK Stroke Collateral Vessels

Leptomeningeal collateral vessels provide connections between vascular territories in the brain when
occlusions occur, e.g., when a person suffers a stroke. The number and connectivity of collateral vessels
varies significantly from patient to patient, and they have been shown to play an important role in stroke
outcomes, providing blood flow to tissue at risk. Rapid and effective patient-specific determination of the
presence and connectivity of collaterals is needed in acute stroke situations to determine which treatments will
be effective. We propose to develop an automated system to evaluate collateral vessel trees from computed
tomography angiography (CTA) images.

In this github repository (https://github.com/KitwareMedical/ITKTubeTK-StrokeCollateralVessels) we are freely releasing
jupyter notebooks for assessing vessel and perfusion characteristics of patients with stroke.
